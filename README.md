# Songs For When

Project developed as way to learn Django. 


In this web application the users can ask for music suggestions and submit suggestions of their own. Better illustrated with examples. 

First of all, you have to login. My rationale to make login required  was that it would be easier to control spam in a production environment. You don't have to register in the site, you can just login using your Google account through OAuth2.

Ok, so imagine that I'm looking for songs to listen while studying. Ok, I'll ask for that... but ups! Someone already did it before! Cool. Well, let's just ask for songs with some cool drumming.

Let's now explore some suggestions done by other users and let's add a suggestion ourselves.
